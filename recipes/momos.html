    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Momos are a popular street food in northern parts of India. These are also known as Dim Sum and are basically dumplings made from flour with a savory stuffing. The momos recipe is also vegan.</p>
    
      
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dough, made with flour salt and lukewarm water</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Capsicum</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Corn</li>
        <li>Paneer</li>
        <li>Bell peppers</li>

      </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
      <ol>
        <li><p><h4>Prepare Dough</h4></p></li>
          <p>The dough is a simple mix of all purpose flour, salt and lukewarm water. Kneading with water creates some steam and a really pliable dough which is perfect for making momos. Once the dough is kneaded (it's not important that its completely smooth), cover it with a damp towel and rest it for 20 minutes. Then cut it into small pieces - each piece should be approx 7 grams.</p>
        <li><p><h4>Momo Filling</h4></p></li>
          <p>The filling is made by stir frying all the ingredients together. This filling is precooked to get rid of any excess water in the veggies. If you don't do this, the water will come out as the momos steam and you'll be left with really soggy momos.</p>
        <li><h4>Pleating momoms</h4></li>
          <ol>
            <li>rool out a small part of dough in a circular form</li>
            
            <li>add filling</li>
            <li>give it the shape</li>
          </ol>
        <li><h4>Steaming Momos</h4></li>
          <p>Both the momos are steamed for 6 minutes. This time is enough to cook the wrapper and the chicken filling which is raw</p>

      </ol>
